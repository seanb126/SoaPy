# SoaPy Python IDE

## Introduction
SoaPy is a functional Python IDE, which includes the ability to run your Python scripts inside an embedded terminal(SoaPy Terminal or xTerm)
or an external terminal(xTerm, Windows cmd.exe, Gnome terminal).

SoaPy was developed using Python and the Tkinter package (see requirements.txt/ or main.py)
Icons used are from https://remixicon.com/.

## Current Issues
- Current app icon produces graphical error, a pure .ico file will need to be created.

## Roadmap
- Re-implement line numbers
- Terminal Selection. Allow the user to select their preferred terminal, either through a settings menu or by clicking the terminal icon
- Implement SoaPy terminal commands, i.e run, ls(search files)
- New font(install into app directory)
- Colour tag text i.e 'print' is yellow in text field
- Ability to check code for syntax / Python errors
