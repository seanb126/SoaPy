# SoaPy | v1.0.1-Alpha

## Introduction
SoaPy is a piece of free and open source software (FOSS) developed in Python for Python developers.
While in the early stages of development, the longterm goal of this project is to develop a usable Python IDE that follows
the FOSS ideoligy.

A simple roadmap has been established to give a generic idea of the future features

Feel free to provide suggestions or report technical issues

## Current Issues
Line numbering re-entered however while improved it still is out of synce when writing at the end of the view, also produces a horrible out of sync glitch when redrawing line numbers. 
Current icon produces graphical error, a pure .ico file will need to be created.

Not an issue per-se however for terminal entries, just use another text field under the terminal to enter commands.

## Roadmap
- Establish basic UI (including novel icons and line numbering)
- Provide file functionality (saving, loading, etc)
- Develop and implement code analysis
- Implement Source Control through Git
- Allow for package extensions
- Automatic file backups
- Terminal recommendations
